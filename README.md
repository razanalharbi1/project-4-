# Introduction
This project part of Data Science Nanodegree where I try to analyse the problem from the given dataset and will present the ML solution to  problem for the Starbucks.
# Project Overview
This project is my Capstone Challenge for Udacityâ€™s Data Scientist Nanodegree. The project is in collaboration with Starbucks where we were given dataset contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. The offer could be purely informational or it could include a discount such as BOGO (buy one get one free).Some users might not receive any offers during certain weeks. Not all users receive the same offer, and that is the challenge to solve with this dataset.
The task is to combine transaction, demographic, and offer data to determine which demographic groups respond best to which offer type.
# Problem Statement
The purpose of this project is to combining transaction, demographic and offer data to see which demographic groups respond best to different types of offers .We will combine 3 datasets :Portfolio, Profile and Transcript .I will create and compare different ML models.
# Data

    portfolio.json - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.).
    profile.json - demographic data for each customer.
    transcript.json - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed.
    Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.* : contains all the work.
